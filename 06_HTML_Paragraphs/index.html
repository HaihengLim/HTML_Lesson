    <!-- <p>
      Intro] Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things
      that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said, "No
      more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars" Yeah, we'll be countin'
      stars [Verse 1] I see this life, like a swinging vine Swing my heart
      across the line And in my face is flashing signs Seek it out and ye shall
      find [Refrain] Old, but I'm not that old Young, but I'm not that bold And
      I don't think the world is sold On just doing what we're told [Pre-Chorus]
      I-I feel something so right Doin' the wrong thing I-I feel something so
      wrong Doin' the right thing I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
      Everything that kills me makes me feel alive [Chorus] Lately, I've been,
      I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things that we could be But
      baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said, "No more countin' dollars,
      we'll be countin' stars" Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
      Dreamin' about the things that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been
      prayin' hard Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin'
      stars" [Verse 2] I feel the love and I feel it burn Down this river every
      turn Hope is a four-letter word Make that money, watch it burn [Refrain]
      Old, but I'm not that old Young, but I'm not that bold And I don't think
      the world is sold On just doing what we're told [Pre-Chorus] I-I feel
      something so right Doin' the wrong thing I-I feel something so wrong Doin'
      the right thing I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie Everything that
      drowns me makes me wanna fly [Chorus] Lately, I've been, I've been losin'
      sleep Dreamin' about the things that we could be But baby, I've been, I've
      been prayin' hard Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin'
      stars" Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things
      that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said, "No
      more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars" [Bridge] Take
      that money and watch it burn Sink in the river the lessons I learned Take
      that money and watch it burn Sink in the river the lessons I learned Take
      that money and watch it burn Sink in the river the lessons I learned Take
      that money and watch it burn Sink in the river the lessons I learned
      [Outro] Everything that kills me makes me feel alive Lately, I've been,
      I've been losin' sleep Dreamin' about the things that we could be But
      baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard Said, "No more countin' dollars,
      we'll be countin' stars" Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
      Dreamin' about the things that we could be But baby, I've been, I've been
      prayin' hard Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin'
      stars" (Take that money and watch it burn) (Sink in the river the lessons
      I learned) (Take that money and watch it burn) (Sink in the river the
      lessons I learned) (Take that money and watch it burn) (Sink in the river
      the lessons I learned) (Take that money and watch it burn) (Sink in the
      river the lessons I learned)
